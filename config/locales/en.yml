# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:
#
# true, false, on, off, yes, no
#
# Instead, surround them with single quotes.
#
# en:
#   'true': 'foo'
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

  faq_question_4: "Can I modify my schedule"
  faq_answer_4: "Of course, as long as you agree with your teacher to change a class that you do not have the power to attend, in order to make this change, you must comply with our cancellation or change policy. If you make the change of a class and both agree it is not necessary to notify a person of the team of 5 Roots, if you have any problem with changing your class then get in touch with us so we can help you."
  faq_question_5: "What happens if the teacher does not show up for the class?"
